                            I'm 23, almost 24 years old. Or, I've turned 18, <strong>5 times.</strong> The highest form of education I have is a completed diploma from the private Catholic institution Saint Xavier I earned in 2013. I briefly attended the University of Louisville's engineering program, enrolled for Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I say briefly because after two semesters, I was failing every class and left on probation in case I want to go back. At the time, I merely burnt myself out working twice as hard as my peers in high school to advance to the classes above my categorization as a low aptitude pupil. Upon entering high school, I did not even understand the concept of fractions. It's as if all my peers were years ahead of me. Because I doubled down and exceeded my own limits to catch up and go beyond, I felt I missed out on any form of social life in high school. I figured I didn't want to be a braniac with no sociability at the start of my real career where I'll be interacting with all kinds of people. The cirriculum of engineering school doesn't allow that mode of experiences. Unhappy with the foresight, I dropped out and pursued entry level jobs that helped me round out my real world experience before engaging my high-octane studying. An absolutely unacceptable function of reasoning in hindsight, but in most cases in life; to truly understand something, you just have to be there.

                            I actually lucked into the school, my Dad just married my Mother-in-Law and her son <strong>just</strong> graduated the school the year I was transitioning to my freshman year. So the choice they made was I was to go to the better school. I hated the idea when I found out, it was sprung on me when my Dad drove me to the campus and surprised me with an entrance exam. I didn't want to go to the school because I wanted to be with my friends, so I bombed the test intentionally. I didn't really have to, I hadn't a clue what the material was. Come to find out, I passed with <strong>one</strong> mark over the condition to be accepted, so really I just guessed well enough to change my life. While there I resented it and just avoided anybody and anything. It was my 4th week I had a change of heart and decided I wanted to make the most of it. I was in the lowest level of classes, with classmates only focused on physical sports. I dug deep, and found out how to work extremely hard. I went from 'level 9' to 'level 2' classes by my senior year, learned Chinese, mastered Pre-calculus and was President of the Computer Technology club for 3 years. Today, I don't have a college degree, but I have the respect and deep friendships of many of who do. Even individuals who don't have college degrees themselves, but have Harvard graduates working for them, I can claim as my equal. I knew I made the right choice for myself when life connected me with who I know and love today. I would have never met them, or been challenged the same way if I erroded my psyche and self esteem in University. I feel satisfied with my choices, and feel rejuvenated with a new but familiar drive to become something even greater.
